## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains my Python practice work for the **PESU - Semester 1 Fundamentals course**.  
Each folder represents a specific concept or topic, demonstrated through **small, well-commented programs**.

I’ve approached these assignments not as rote exercises, but as **mini explorations** of how Python works — from logic and syntax to problem solving.
